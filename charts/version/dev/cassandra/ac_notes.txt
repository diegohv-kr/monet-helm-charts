//we need to determine how to make the storageclass size variable per env. - make it a variable int he pipelines

//after the upgrade the existing nodes don't get the cahnges as they are running. I ended up killing them to get them to restart and pick up.
//seems that there should be a cleaner way.

//to see if the nodes are up, run
nodetool status
//inside of an existing pod

//create package
// cassandra/install.sh
